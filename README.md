# strings-and-numbers

Hi Ash. So I clearly still need a lot of practice and exposure to JavaScript. I am having a difficult time grasping it. I only accomplished this based on the sample code we did together in class. I spent yesterday and this morning trying to learn it and while my understanding is a bit better, I have a long wau to go. I'm going to submit this as is because I have a lot of work to do on Tony's final assignment for 260 still. 

Happy Thanksgiving!
